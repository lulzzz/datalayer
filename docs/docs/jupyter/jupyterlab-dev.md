## JupyterLab Dev

[JupyterLab Docs for Dev](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/repo.html).

[TypeScript Doc](http://jupyterlab.github.io/jupyterlab/index.html).

[Phosphor.js Datagrid](http://phosphorjs.github.io/examples/datagrid).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab.git
cd jupyterlab
pip install -e .
# Use `jlpm` or globally installed `yarn`
yarn install
```

```bash
# Build the core mode assets (optional).
yarn run build:core
# Builds the source files into javascript files in lib folder.
yarn run build
jupyter lab build
jupyter lab --dev-mode --watch --browser chromium-browser
```

Building consists of:

+ Populating the staging/ directory using template files
+ Handling any locally installed packages
+ Ensuring all installed assets are available
+ Bundling the assets
+ Copying the bundled assets to the static directory

Note that building will always use the latest JavaScript packages that meet the dependency requirements of JupyterLab itself and any installed extensions. If you wish to run JupyterLab with the set of pinned requirements that was shipped with the Python package, you can launch as jupyter lab â€“core-mode.

```bash
# At times, it may be necessary to clean your local repo with the command yarn run clean:slate.
# This will clean the repository, and re-install and rebuild.
yarn run clean:slate
# Deletes the lib directory.
yarn run clean 
```

```bash
yarn run build:test
yarn test
```

```bash
# Build more accurate sourcemaps that show the original Typescript code when debugging.
# However, it takes a bit longer to build the sources, so is used only to build for production by default.
yarn run build:dev:prod
```

```bash
# cd docs
yarn run docs
open ./docs/index.html
open ./docs/api/index.html
```

```bash
ls /home/datalayer/opt/miniconda3/share/jupyter/lab
extensions  schemas  settings  staging  static  themes
```

## JupyterLab Examples

[JupyterLab Examples Docs](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/examples.html).

```bash
yarn run build:examples
```

```bash
cd examples/cell
python main.py
```

## JupyterLab Renderers

```bash
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/fasta-extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/geojson-extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/katex-extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/plotly-extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/vega2-extension
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-renderers.git
cd jupyter-renderers
yarn install
yarn run build
```

```bash
# Link all extensions in packages.
yarn run link
# Link geojson-extension only.
jupyter labextension link packages/geojson-extension
# After making changes to the source packages, the jupyter packages must be rebuilt.
# Rebuild the source.
cd $DLAHOME/repos/jupyterlab
jupyter lab build
```

```bash
# You may also watch the jupyter-renderers directory for changes and automatically rebuild.
# In one terminal tab, watch the jupyter-renderers directory.
yarn watch
# In another terminal tab, run jupyterlab with the watch flag.
jupyter lab --watch
```

## JupyterLab Extensions Dev

[JupyterLab Extensions Dev](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer/extension_dev.html).

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-cookiecutter-ts
# In Extension Repo.
yarn install
yarn run build
jupyter labextension link .
yarn watch
# In Jupyterlab Repo.
cd $DLAHOME/repos/jupyterlab
jupyter lab build
jupyter lab --watch
jupyter lab --dev-mode
jupyter lab --dev-mode --watch
jupyter lab --core-mode
```

```bash
cd $DLAHOME/repos/datalayer-jupyterlab
yarn install
yarn run build
jupyter labextension install
```

```bash
cd $DLAHOME/repos/datalayer-jupyterlab
jupyter labextension link
yarn watch
cd $DLAHOME/repos/jupyterlab
jupyter lab --watch
```

```bash
# Installation and activation of Git handler
# Installation and activation for jupyterlab_git python handler package:
cd $DLAHOME/repos/jupyterlab-git
pip install .
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_git
yarn install
yarn run build
jupyter labextension install
# Launch JupyterLab & you will see the new Git buttons on the left side of the window.
jupyter lab
```

```bash
# If you must install a extension into a development branch of JupyterLab, you have to graft it into the source tree of JupyterLab itself. This may be done using the command.
yarn run add:sibling $DLAHOME/repos/datalayer-jupyterlab
jupyter lab --dev-mode --watch
# In the JupyterLab root directory, where <path-or-url> refers either to an extension npm package on the local filesystem, or a URL to a git repository for an extension npm package. This operation may be subsequently reversed by running.
yarn run remove:sibling $DLAHOME/repos/datalayer-jupyterlab
```

## JupyterLab VDOM

```bash
pip install vdom
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nteract/vdom
cd vdom
pip install -e .
```

## Publish JupyterLab Extensions

```bash
npm login
npm config set scope datalayer
# Publishing extensions.
npm publish --access=public
```
