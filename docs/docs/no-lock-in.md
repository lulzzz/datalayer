The `Datalayer Science Platform` runs on any **Kubernetes Cluster**.

A cheap cluster can be created with [Datalayer Pilot](/docs/pilot) even based on low-cost Spot Instances.

If you are targeting higher requirements for `Alpha` or `Production` with higher budget available, you can reuse the deliverable on any Kubernetes compliant cluster such as [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) or [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service).
