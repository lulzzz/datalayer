# Datalayer Connector

This module ensures the connection to external products and services, in respect of legal and technical constraints.

## Social Connectors

In most cases, there are REST API endpoints  being protected by OAuth authentication.

We are working on the following connectors:

+ Twitter
+ Facebook
+ Linkedin

The underlying technical library is hosted on the [Datalayer Platform Droids](https://github.com/datlayer/platform/) repository.
