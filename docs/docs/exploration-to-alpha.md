title: From Exploration to Alpha
---

We fully support the usage of the exploration artifacts stored in the `Library` into a Alpha environment.

With Datalayer, no more issue. We ship by default Big Data storage (Apache Hadoop) and analytics (Spark) so you are not limited. This allows also to fully reuse what you have done in the Exploration for your Alpha. Still with the ease and flexibility of the well known Python, R... tooling most Data Scientists love to work with.
