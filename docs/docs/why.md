title: More Value for your Data Science Projects
---

Current projects organisation is not enough agile and can be summarized as a series of steps, with separated phases.

Datalayer shuffles the phases and allows better agility and collaboration while raising the bar to prepare a faster and cheaper `Go-to-Alpha`.

+ [Lower your cloud costs](/docs/cost-less) with cheap resources your can easily schedule on any cloud.
+ [IT-Less](/docs/it-less) - You can setup Big Data in the Cloud as easily as installing a software on your laptop.
+ Don't bother with Virtual Machines anymore, we are [Serverless](/docs/serverless).
+ We ensure [no vendor and no cloud Lock-In](/docs/no-lock-in). Feel free to move whenever you want and reuse 100% of your code and science investements.
+ Enable [Data Story Telling](/docs/collaborative-story-telling) and ship beautiful User Interface for Data Scientists and Business.
+ Think to [Alpha while Exploring](/docs/exploration-to-alpha) to create scalable Data Products.
