We are building a `Simple`, `Collaborative` and `Multi Cloud` platform for Big Data Scientists.

You will analyse data and share results with `Spark`, `Python` and `R` on the `Datalayer Explorer` (`Web Notebook`) on a `Kubernetes` cluster.

This repository contains the documentation and is the place to organize (issues, project board...) the other Datalayer repositories that build up the platform.
